### Why I like this:

I find this article interesting as it talks about the intersection between the fields of marketing and computer science. My primary career interest lies in marketing, but I'm learning computer science to develop a technical perspective on an age-old occupation.

The other reason why I like this is because it explains a few ways i which sentient analysis can be done. One way is using machine learning, which is what I used to make a small sentiment analysis project.

#### Added Comment from Jordan Zhao

Sentiment analysis is definitely helpful to be more engaging with customers. Recently my company began adding CS majors to the marketing team especially in the realm of big data analytics. I guess they did that for the reason you mentioned!
